## Introduction
`Vidlium` is a simply powerful tool to bring in remote guests into software like OBS Studio. Vidlium software helps livestream directors manage guests in multiple video chats, personalize their guestâ€™s experiences, and control video feeds with advanced settings.

_Its fully browser based, uses vdo.ninja under the hood, and is open-source as well as completely free for everyone to use._

<br>

Check out some of the 'sister repos' of vidlium_website, you can find code for other parts of the website/software/system here:
- [Vidlium_Director](https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/vidlium_director)
- [Vidlium_Docs](https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/vidlium_docs)

## Usage

To start using Vidlium, the web version _(currently the only version)_ of the software is best. You can get started immediately at [vidlium.com](https://vidlium.com). The website provides access to the system as well as additional information on the code and how to do basic things via the [docs & guides](https://docs.vidlium.com).


## Development

<details>
<summary>
Pre-requisites
</summary> <br />
To be able to start development on Vidlium make sure that you have the following pre-requisites installed:

###

- Node.js v16 or above
- Git

Starting Vidlium
</summary> <br />

###

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/vidlium_website.git && cd vidlium_website && npm install
```

2. Run the 'cert' script, which initiates creating SSL certificates for local domain name `test.vidlium.com`:
> 
```shell
npm run cert
```
> **Note:**
> When running `cert`, it may prompt you about needing to create a password. This is a password for the device's devcert Certificate Authority, which you will need to use if you are ever creating a new domain with devcert. In this case, you should only need to enter this once.
> 
> You only need to do this step initially after first downloading, only do step 3 for subsequent times when spinning up the dev server.

3. Run the 'start' script, which takes care of making a dev-build with gulp and creating a live reloading server for local hosting:
```shell
npm run start
```

The development environment should now be set up. 

- Navigate to [test.vidlium.com/dist](https://test.vidlium.com/dist) _(in chrome)_ for the home-page with automatic reload for when you change code.

Additional information on the devcert, the system used for setting up the SSL and custom domains, can be found in [DEVCERT.md](devcert.md). Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
